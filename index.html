        <p>
          I am originally from Marshville, North Carolina, but currently live in
          Wilmington. I graduated from the University of North Carolina at
          Wilmington in 2007 with an English degree with a teacher's license.
          Over the years, I have discovered that one of my passions is computer
          technology. This has led me to getting a Full Stack Web Developer
          Certification from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope to use the skills that I have obtained over the years to assist
          me in my venture to change my career path into something I really love
          and enjoy. My goal is to continue learning even after the program has
          completed and to be able to build on skills learned in this course.
